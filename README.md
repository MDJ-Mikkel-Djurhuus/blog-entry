# The new age of Software Development (WIP)

In the wave of new age technologies, the technology industry is witnessing new tools and methods of Software Development in order to have faster and better quality of development. There are not just many tools for software developers but there are new development methodologies for software development experts to explore areas of software development processes.

Among these processes, DevOps is the next big thing in the IT industry. More Software Developers are now choosing DevOps and IT Companies are also training their resources with DevOps management. It is in fact reducing the gap between Services of Software Development and the IT Solutions that are used for enterprises or businesses.

DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice, that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops).

As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, rather than a single DevOps tool there are sets (or "toolchains") of multiple tools.[13] Such DevOps tools are expected to fit into one or more of these categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:[14][15]

- Code — code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
- Build — continuous integration tools, build status
- Test — continuous testing tools that provide feedback on business risks
- Package — artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
- Release — change management, release approvals, release automation
- Configure — infrastructure configuration and management, Infrastructure as Code tools
- Monitor — applications performance monitoring, end–user experience

The goals of DevOps span the entire delivery pipeline. They include:

- Improved deployment frequency;
- Faster time to market;
- Lower failure rate of new releases;
- Shortened lead time between fixes;
- Faster mean time to recovery (in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system).
